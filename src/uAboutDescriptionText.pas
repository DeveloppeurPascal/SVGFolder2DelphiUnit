This program is designed for Delphi developers wishing to use vector images (in SVG format) into their projects.

It generates a unit from the list of SVG files contained in a folder.

An SVG list is created as an array of multilines strings containing the textual source code of each vector image.

Constants and an enumeration containing the unit name and the SVG file names provide the indices of the associated source code in the list. This makes it easier to find your way around and manage several SVG lists in a single project.
